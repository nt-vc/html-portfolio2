<h1>Noah's Greatest Movies of All Time (That He's Watched)</h1>

<h2> Top 3 That I Can Think of Right Now</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Inglorious Basterds</h3>

<p>Really fucking fire. Lots of blood, tension, dramatics. Brad Pitt!</p>

<h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>

<p> Is it really one of my top 3? I don't know. But I just remembered it existed right now. And it was pretty good!</p>

<h3>The Barbie Movie</h3>

<p> I mean, obviously. Who doesn't love a two hour advertisement?</p>
